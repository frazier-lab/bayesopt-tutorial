# Bayesopt Tutorial

This repository has tutorial python code for Bayesian optimization. The goal is to help people with a basic familiarity with python learn how to run Bayesian optimization in BoTorch. There is a companion tutorial paper, [https://arxiv.org/pdf/1807.02811.pdf](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1807.02811.pdf).

Essential Topics:
- Tutorial 1: [Gaussian process regression in pure python](https://github.com/frazier-lab/bayesopt-tutorial/blob/main/tutorial1/Tutorial1_GP_Regression_in_Pure_Python.ipynb)
- Tutorial 2: [Gaussian process regression in BoTorch](https://github.com/frazier-lab/bayesopt-tutorial/blob/main/tutorial2/Tutorial2_GP_Regression_in_BoTorch.ipynb)
- Tutorial 3: [Expected improvement](https://github.com/frazier-lab/bayesopt-tutorial/blob/main/tutorial3/Tutorial3_ExpectedImprovement_in_BoTorch.ipynb)

Advanced Topics:
- Tutorial 4: [BayesOpt of composite functions](https://github.com/frazier-lab/bayesopt-tutorial/blob/main/tutorial4/Tutorial4_Composite_Functions.ipynb)
- Tutorial 5: [Parallel BayesOpt with the Knowledge Gradient acquisition function](https://github.com/frazier-lab/bayesopt-tutorial/blob/main/tutorial5/Tutorial5_Parallel_KG.ipynb) 

These python tutorials are also used in a short-course teaching Bayesian optimization over a few days with complementary lectures. This was last taught as part of the [Optimization, Big Data, and Applications machine learning summer school](https://sites.google.com/diag.uniroma1.it/oba2022/) in Veroli, Italy near Rome in 2022, and at Lancaster University in the UK in 2020. Here is a [link to the 2022 course materials](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1mFAa27I0kIeDQPnEXFmUC2qyhf1YO8AHOh-BAqF42oY/edit?usp=sharing).
