# Bayesopt Tutorial

This repository contains tutorial python code for Bayesian optimization. The goal is to help people with a basic familiarity with python learn how to run Bayesian optimization in BoTorch. These tutorials have a companion tutorial paper, available for free on the arxiv, [https://arxiv.org/pdf/1807.02811.pdf](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1807.02811.pdf).

- Tutorial 1: Gaussian process regression in pure python [pdf](https://github.com/frazier-lab/bayesopt-tutorial/blob/main/tutorial1/Tutorial1_GP_Regression_in_Pure_Python.pdf) [ipynb](https://github.com/frazier-lab/bayesopt-tutorial/blob/main/tutorial1/Tutorial1_GP_Regression_in_Pure_Python.ipynb)

These python tutorials have also been used in a short-course format where Bayesian optimization was taught over the course of a few days with lectures on the theory of Bayesian optimization followed by python labs. These courses were taught as part of the [Optimization, Big Data, and Applications machine learning summer school](https://sites.google.com/diag.uniroma1.it/oba2022/) in Veroli, Italy near Rome in 2022, and at Lancaster University in the UK in 2020. Here is a [link to the full course materials](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1mFAa27I0kIeDQPnEXFmUC2qyhf1YO8AHOh-BAqF42oY/edit?usp=sharing) from the 2022 version of the course.
